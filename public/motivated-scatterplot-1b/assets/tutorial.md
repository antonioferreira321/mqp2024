# Instructions - Study Specifics

In this experiment, we will ask you to estimate the correlation between two variables.  
Here are some examples of graphs with different correlations. Each dot represents one data point.  
These data points are graphed along the X and Y axes.  
Below is an example of a correlation of 0. This means that the two variables are not correlated at all.

Below are some examples of correlations ranging from 0.3 to 0.9.

Correlations can also have negative values, ranging from 0 to -1.  
While positive correlations indicate an increase in both variables, negative correlations indicate an increase in one variable and a decrease in the other.

Below are examples of negative correlations ranging from -0.3 to -0.9.

So, the closer the correlation is to 1 or -1, the stronger the relationship between the two variables.  
The closer the correlation is to 0, the weaker the relationship between the two variables.
